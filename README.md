# Semester Simulator 
Semester Simulator is a text-based game where you play as a student managing your semester. You make choices about course load and study focus, which impact your GPA, stress, study hours, and social points. At the end of the game, your performance is evaluated to give you a realistic outcome such as making the Dean's List, having a solid semester, or ending up on probabtion. 

# Branching Concepts Demonstrated 
The program demonstrates if/elif/else branching in Step 2, where the choice of course load (A, B, or C) changes study hours and stress level. It also demonstrates nested if statements in Step 4, where GPA, stress, and social points are checked together to decide the final ending. It also demonstrates the use of logical operators (and,or,not) in Step 3, where GPA and subject choices combine (for example, when English is chosen and GPA is less than 3.0). It also demonstrates membership operators (in,not in) in Step 3, where the program validates the study options, and also in Step 4, where it checks for synergy between major and study subject. Finally, it demonstrates identity operators (is,is not) in Step 4, where the program checks that the player's input is stored as a string, and verifies that it is not an integer. 

# How to Run Game 
1. Save the code in a file called semester_simulator.py
2. Open a terminal or VS Code terminal 
3. Run the program with: py semester_simulator.py
4. Follow the prompts 
5. Read your updated stats and final semester report

# Different Endings
Dean's List: High GPA with balanced stress and social points. 
Solid Semester: Passing with balance, but room for improvement. 
On Probation: Low GPA and/or very high stress
Needs Academic Recovery: Overloaded or unbalanced choices lead to setbacks 
*each ending is designed to represent different real-life student outcomes. 

# AI Assistance
AI (ChatGPT) was used during the development of this project to explain branching concepts such as the use of is, is not, and nested if statements. It also provided suggestions for structuring the game, ensuring that all required operators and branching examples were included.
